# RoboND_3D_Perception
*In this project, A PR2 robot outfitted with an RGB-D camera is given a cluttered tabletop scenario where a perception pipeline using Filtering, Downsampling, Segmentation, Clustering and Object Recognition is used to identify target objects from a so-called “Pick-List” in a particular order, pick up those objects and place them in corresponding dropboxes.*

**Gazebo, RViz, Moveit!** are used for simulating the environment in this project and **Python with ROS** is choosed to be this project's code language.

This is a `README` that includes all the key points and how I addressed each one.
